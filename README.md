## üßê What?
"Gaming Advanced Statistical Analysis" is a data analytical work on simulated gaming data obtained from a set of gamers. This is only one among different works during my descriptive and predictive data course. In this course, I choose and apply advanced analytical techniques to  datasets to gain different insights which may not be obtained in conventional data analysis.

The data here includes spending on online games, gamer characteristics including age, income, gender, their main motivation to play, type of games they like and the genre of games they like most. The surveys are conducted every month, hence answers change over time.

## ü§∑ Why?  
Descriptive and predictive analytics tools are used in many application areas for explaining and forecasting data patterns. In business, data is collected over time and the data represents choices from multiple alternatives. In addition, when multiple cross sectional instances of the same phenomena e.g. from different individuals, customers, companies or inventory locations are observed over time, panel data models allow for characterizing individual patterns as well as data patterns over time to improve data description and prediction. Such time dependence and cross sectional dependence in data are not accounted for in conventional data analysis methods.

## ‚öíÔ∏è How?  
Main techniques used in this work are: summary statistics, time series analysis, vector autoregression (VAR), panel data analysis, logit modelling.
